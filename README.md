# FlitsDraw

I must make a confession, I have been a Macromedia Flash fanboy for almost my entire life (for as long as that is possible). And I have the feeling that I have been missing out. Some time ago I started an initiative to start creating my own tools. And a Flash "like" vector draw application has been on my todo liwt for some time. So this repo is a attempt at creating something like that.
